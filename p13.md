Project Clients: Muhammad Raheel Raza
Project specializations: Software Development;Web Application Development;
Number of groups: 5 groups
Main contact: Muhammad Raheel Raza
Background:
o Streamline e-invoicing processes for SMEs by leveraging e-invoicing APIs.
o Test different assigned e-invoicing APIs and identify the endpoint functions on a GUI.
o Reduce manual intervention and errors associated with traditional invoicing
methods.
o Enhance efficiency and accuracy in invoice generation, validation, and transmission
Requirements and Scope:
o Development of a business process flow for e-invoicing encompassing creation,
validation and transmission categories.
o Design of a fully functional front-end application or GUI, testing the e-invoicing API
via different endpoints and demonstrating the endpoint functions.
o Identification and demonstration of the API endpoint functions on GUI.
o Documentation of the implemented API service and API integration guidelines for
SMEs.
Required Knowledge and skills:
o Selection of suitable e-invoicing APIs based on compatibility with SME systems,
regulatory compliance, and cost-effectiveness.
o Test different selected/assigned e-invoicing APIs by writing clients and identify the
endpoint functions on a GUI.
o The GUI should show each specific API endpoint to the user and produce results.
o Implementation of data encryption and privacy measures to safeguard sensitive
invoicing information in the front-end.
Expected outcomes/deliverables:
o Fully functional source code.
o An in-depth report documenting the entire project process.
o A testing GUI interface showing each specific API endpoint functionality.
o API documentation provided by the selected e-invoicing service providers, including
API endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods & error handling
procedures.
o Detailed documentation outlining the business process flow, API integration steps
and usage guidelines for SMEs.
